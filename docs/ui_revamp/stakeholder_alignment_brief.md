# Stakeholder Alignment Brief

## Purpose
This brief communicates the final UI revamp decisions and execution timeline so design, product, and engineering stay in lockstep.

## Summary of Decisions
- The design system now follows the typography, color, and spacing tokens defined in `ui_design_decision_record.md`.
- A unified app chrome layer (`AppScaffold` + `AppChromeController`) will manage status/navigation bars and app bar behaviour across screens.
- Shared components (buttons, cards, headers, feedback blocks) will expose configuration via theme tokens instead of inline styles.
- All presentation-layer copy will move to localization files; category and stats metadata will be sourced dynamically without altering the learning mock data repository.

## Execution Timeline
1. **Week 1:** Implement theme/token groundwork and the chrome/controller layer; update button/header components.
2. **Week 2:** Migrate Home, Courses, and Tests screens to the new system; add shared empty/error state widgets.
3. **Week 3:** Finish My Courses, Profile, and remaining shared screens; populate localization entries; run full regression QA.

## Responsibilities
- **Design:** Provide any asset updates (illustrations, icon tweaks) that align with the new palette; review staging build end of Week 2.
- **Product:** Validate copy changes against brand tone; approve localized strings before Week 3 QA.
- **Engineering:** Execute refactors, ensure testing coverage, and surface regressions promptly; coordinate with backend for dynamic metadata when ready.

## Communication Plan
- Engineering posts twice-weekly status in #vidyaras-app with highlights, blockers, and upcoming work.
- A standing 30-minute sync (Mon/Thu) is reserved for cross-functional review while the revamp is in flight.
- Major decision changes must be logged in `ui_design_decision_record.md` with timestamps and owners.

## Launch Gates
- `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` must pass cleanly.
- Visual QA sign-off from design demonstrating light/dark parity and accessibility checks (contrast, tap targets, dynamic type).
- Product validation of localized copy and referral/share flows.

The decisions and schedule above are approved; teams should proceed unless a new brief supersedes this document.
