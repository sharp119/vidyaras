# Flutter Project: Code Generation & Architectural Guidelines

This document outlines the official guidelines and architectural rules for this project. All code, whether written manually or generated by a tool, must adhere to these standards to ensure consistency, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

## üèõÔ∏è Core Philosophy

Our primary goal is to build a robust and scalable application. This is achieved through three core principles:

1.  **Strict Separation of Concerns:** The architecture is non-negotiable. Each piece of code has a specific role and location.
2.  **Readability and Maintainability:** Code must be clear, concise, and easy for any developer to understand.
3.  **Performance and Scalability:** We build with the future in mind, ensuring the app can handle growth in features and user load.

## üèóÔ∏è The Architecture: Feature-First Layered Approach

We use a **Feature-First Layered Architecture**, inspired by Clean Architecture. The project is organized into feature modules (e.g., `media_feed`, `user_profile`), and each feature is divided into distinct layers.

**Dependency Rule:** Dependencies must always flow inwards. The UI depends on the application logic, which depends on the core domain, but the domain knows nothing about the outer layers.

### Directory Structure

The following structure must be used for every feature:
