# Quiz System - Complete Implementation ✅

## 🎉 Summary

All 5 public quizzes have been successfully added to the database with full question sets. All issues have been resolved.

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Added 5 New Public Quizzes**

All quizzes are set as `is_published = true` and `is_public = true`, making them available to all users without course enrollment.

| Quiz ID | Title | Questions | Time | Full Marks | Difficulty |
|---------|-------|-----------|------|------------|------------|
| db1ebef1... | Indian Music Fundamentals (Mixed) | 12 | 25 min | 120 | beginner |
| 8bd9ca65... | Advanced Raga and Tala Theory | 11 | 30 min | 130 | advanced |
| 47461b4a... | Musicians and Instruments | 12 | 25 min | 120 | intermediate |
| 7de817df... | Calculus Basics | 10 | 30 min | 100 | intermediate |
| b9c8ce34... | General Musical Knowledge | 15 | 35 min | 150 | intermediate |

**Total Questions Added:** 60 questions across 5 quizzes

---

### 2. **Fixed Question Count Showing 0**

**Problem:** Quiz cards showed "0 questions" instead of actual question count.

**Root Cause:** Line 87 in `test_repository_impl.dart` had:
```dart
questionCount: 0, // Will be fetched separately if needed
```

**Solution:** Added real-time question counting for each quiz:
```dart
// Count questions for this quiz
final questionCountResponse = await _supabase
    .from('questions')
    .select()
    .eq('quiz_id', quizId);

final questionCount = (questionCountResponse as List).length;
```

**Result:** ✅ Each quiz now displays its actual question count (10-15 questions)

---

### 3. **Fixed Time Allotted Mismatch**

**Problem:** UI showed "15 minutes" but quiz actually had "30 minutes" allotted.

**Root Cause:** The old sample quiz in database had inconsistent time_allotted_minutes value.

**Solution:**
- Deleted old sample quiz with incorrect data
- Added 5 new quizzes with correct time allocations:
  - Indian Music Fundamentals: **25 minutes**
  - Advanced Raga Theory: **30 minutes**
  - Musicians and Instruments: **25 minutes**
  - Calculus Basics: **30 minutes**
  - General Musical Knowledge: **35 minutes**

**Result:** ✅ Time displayed matches actual time allotted from database

---

### 4. **User Stats Sync with Real Data**

**Implementation:** User stats are already synced correctly:

```dart
// Calculate stats
final totalTests = quizzes.length;
final completedTests = attempts.length;
final double avgScore = attempts.isEmpty
    ? 0.0
    : attempts.fold<double>(
            0.0, (sum, attempt) => sum + (attempt['percentage'] ?? 0.0)) /
        attempts.length;
```

**Stats Card Now Shows:**
- ✅ **Total Tests**: Count of all published quizzes (currently 5)
- ✅ **Completed**: Count of user's completed quiz attempts
- ✅ **Average Score**: Calculated from all user's quiz attempt percentages

**Guest User Support:**
- Users without login automatically use guest user ID: `060b2882-a066-42b5-bdd8-1c3a609a407f`
- Stats are tracked for guest user just like any authenticated user
- When user logs in later, they get their own separate stats

---

### 5. **Completed Tests Section**

**Implementation:** Already working correctly:

```dart
// Separate available and completed tests
for (var quiz in quizzes) {
  final quizId = quiz['id'] as String;
  final isCompleted = attemptedQuizIds.contains(quizId);

  if (isCompleted) {
    completedTestsList.add(test); // Shows in Completed section
  } else {
    availableTests.add(test); // Shows in Available section
  }
}
```

**Completed Section Shows:**
- ✅ Quiz title and details
- ✅ Best score percentage (from multiple attempts)
- ✅ "View Results" button
- ✅ "Retake" button

**Upon Quiz Completion:**
1. Quiz attempt saved to `quiz_attempts` table with `is_completed = true`
2. All answers saved to `user_answers` table
3. Score and percentage auto-calculated via database trigger
4. Next time user opens Tests tab:
   - Quiz appears in "Completed Tests" section
   - Shows best score if multiple attempts exist
   - User can view results or retake
