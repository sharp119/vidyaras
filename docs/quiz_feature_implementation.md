# Quiz Feature Implementation Guide

## Overview

The quiz/test-taking feature has been successfully implemented for the VidyaRas app following the Feature-First Layered Architecture. This feature allows users to take timed multiple-choice quizzes, view their results, and review their answers. The entire workflow is functional using a centralized mock data source.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Quiz Taking
- **Dynamic Questions**: Fetches questions from a central repository based on the test ID.
- **Timer**: Countdown timer that auto-submits the quiz on expiry.
- **Navigation**: Full support for "Previous/Next" and grid navigation via the `QuestionNavigator`.

### 2. Quiz Results
- **Results Summary**: A dedicated screen shows the final percentage score, correct/incorrect counts, and time taken.
- **Navigation**: Users can navigate from the results screen to review their answers or go back to the main test list.

### 3. Answer Review
- **Detailed Review**: A dedicated screen lists every question from the quiz.
- **Visual Feedback**: Each question card clearly marks the correct answer (in green) and the user's incorrect answer (in red), making it easy to learn from mistakes.

## 🏗️ Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Verified Compliance
- [x] Feature-First Layered Architecture followed.
- [x] All data centralized in the mock repository (`test_repository_impl.dart`), resolving data discrepancies.
- [x] UI (Presentation) is fully decoupled from the data source, consuming data from the repository interface.
- [x] Used existing reusable components and theme colors/gradients.
- [x] No business logic in the Presentation Layer.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Make Production-Ready:

1.  **Replace Mock Data Source with API**:
    * Modify `TestRepositoryImpl` to make real `dio` API calls instead of returning hardcoded data. The UI and Application layers will not need to change due to the repository pattern.

2.  **Add Persistence**:
    * Save quiz progress locally (e.g., using Hive) to allow users to resume interrupted quizzes.
    * Store quiz results to track user history and performance over time.

3.  **Add Bilingual Support**:
    * Use `AppLocalizations` for all static strings on the quiz, results, and review screens.
    * Ensure question/answer models can support both English and Hindi text.

4.  **Enhance Analytics**:
    * Track metrics like time spent per question, quiz completion rates, and common incorrect answers.

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Navigation Flow
1.  **Test Series Screen** -> `context.push('/test/test-id')` -> **Quiz Screen**
2.  **Quiz Screen** -> `context.go('/test/test-id/results', extra: ...)` -> **Quiz Results Screen**
3.  **Quiz Results Screen** -> `context.push('/test/test-id/review', extra: ...)` -> **Answer Review Screen**

---

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**: The entire quiz workflow UI is complete and functional with mock data.
